# The dog doesn't want to eat

The dog looks at me at the bowl as if I had served him boiled broccoli with a "what is this?" expression.
I bring the food closer and he smells it with distrust, then turns around offended, as if instead of kibble I had given him taxes.
I insist: "Come on, eat, you love this!".
He responds with his look: "Let's see, human, would you eat the same thing every day? Kibble in the morning, kibble in the afternoon, kibble at night! Not even Netflix repeats series this much".

And there he stays, lying down, waiting for me to bring him a juicy steak or at least a pizza with extra cheese.
